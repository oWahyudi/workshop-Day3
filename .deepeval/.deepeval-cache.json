It adjusts its internal parameters to improve accuracy.\\n- Common problem types:\\n  - Supervised learning: learn from labeled data to predict a target (e.g., house prices, spam detection, image classification).\\n  - Unsupervised learning: find structure in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation, clustering, dimensionality reduction).\\n  - Reinforcement learning: an agent learns by interacting with an environment to maximize rewards (e.g., game playing, robotics).\\n- Typical workflow: define the problem, collect and preprocess data, split into training/validation/test sets, choose a model, train, evaluate, tune, deploy, and monitor.\\n- Popular algorithms: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, support vector machines, neural networks (deep learning), clustering (k-means), etc.\\n- Considerations: data quality and bias, overfitting/underfitting, interpretability, privacy, and how well the model generalizes to new data.\\n\\nExamples of applications: email spam filtering, image and speech recognition, product recommendations, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance.\\n\\nIf you want, I can tailor this to a specific domain or dive into a particular type of machine learning.\", \"context\": [\"Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development.\"], \"expected_output\": \"Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.\", \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"What is Machine Learning\", \"retrieval_context\": null}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Hallucination", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The score is 0.00 because the actual output fully aligns with the context, providing accurate expansions without introducing any contradictions or unsupported information.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-4.1", "evaluationCost": 0, "verboseLogs": "Verdicts:\n[\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": \"The actual output agrees with the context, which states that machine learning is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with development.
